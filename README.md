#  Crypto coins on SwiftUI + Clean architecture + Combine + MVVM

![project](project.gif)

## What I created

I made an application for fetching Crypto coins from [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3#/)

## What I Used

* Rest API requests for fetch coins and their details
* Used the MVVM architecture + Combine. 
* Used 'Clean architecture' for the project structure
* Used SwiftUI for UI
* Used custom 'AsyncImage' for cache images
